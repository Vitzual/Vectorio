# Vectorio | Source Code
Source code for the upcoming game, Vectorio!

Looking to help contribute to the games development? Take a look at the instructions below and make sure you've already contacted me beforehand before starting, as it is important I keep track of everything being added.

**How to start making contributions**
1) Contact @Vitzual#0001 on Discord.
2) Clone the repo from the link below.
3) Download Unity version `2020.3.2f1`
4) Make changes / add new ideas.
5) Upload files to your own branch!

**Important reminder when contributing**
- I will NOT accept PR requests! 
- Code shared must be a link from your branch.
- Always contact me before making a contribution.
- Do not steal any code or assets that aren't yours.
- DO NOT use anything from Unity's asset store! 

**Important:** We're planning to do a rewrite of Survival.cs as it is a mess and contains outdated segments of code that we used when first testing with Unity. Please avoid this script until we make the necessary changes to clean it up. If you have questions about it, feel free to let me know on Discord.
